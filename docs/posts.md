What follows might appear to be an unconscious stream of thoughts... and it probably is. I learn by teaching. Drawing from Richard Feynman's principle that true understanding means being able to explain something simply, I use this blog to break down concepts in coding, statistics, mathematics, and beyond. If I can teach it here, I know I've learned it.
