<h1 style="color:red">  HEALTH WARNING </h1>
<span style="color:red"> I write to think. What's written here is to a degree for me. But I believe it can help others understand me better and that's why I share it. This alligns with one of my core principles to **Be who I am 100% of the time**, what you see is what you get! </span>

# &#129300; Who I am

I've gained insight into myself through feedback and personality tests, consistently being authentic in all aspects of my life. Early on, [DISC](https://www.discprofile.com/) assessments identified me as highly directive, but I've noticed these profiles evolve over time. A later test done via [Insights/Myers-Briggs](/assets/pdf/Insights_Directing_Motivator.pdf) identified me as a 'directing motivator.' This "motivating" trait developed in response to my work environment, emphasizing the importance of teamwork over individual effort. Organization isn't my strongest suit, and so I've learned that high thoughput can be achieved by leveraging strong strategic (& thus) motivational vision with carefully applied effective processes. This approach helps me concentrate on productivity and in a team setting minimizes unnecessary conflict.

At the end of 2023 as part of a reflective end of year exercise [year compass](https://yearcompass.com/) I started to deeply think about where I want to get to. I'd been (re-)reading up on [OKRs](https://amzn.to/42gQa1r) for my team and decided to set my own OKRs for the year. To help me do this I felt it important to refine my principles, I've always felt they were important for a team, so why not me! Ray Dalio has a nice worked exercise book to help you uncover [your own principles](https://amzn.to/496Ty18) which I have started doing. My plan is as these develop to add them here, so that I can live my first principle, being who I am all of the time.

# My Values
My core leading values are to *create something new*, I like to be at the edge where new things are made. That has been building new things, whether they are tech, or scoping projects or helpingto set up teams. I like to get things set up in a way that they are ready to be taken forwards.  This leads me to my next value *to help others*, I've always been blessed to have been helped by others and I find real joy in helping others get to that AHA! moment. It's usually as simple as helping folks think through things or connecting the right people or team together. Most importantly my last leading vales is *to have a thriving family*, I adore my kids and I wish I had more time for them. Whats most important for me is that they are set up for sucess as they will undoubtably have a larger impact on the world than I ever will.  

In my lagging values, to a degree I dont particularly care the final destination my career takes me to. I don't need to be a CEO of a big company. I was once asked would I prefer to be a small part of something big or a big part of something small, my answer is most certainly the latter. At a micro level thats my family, but at a macro level Ive not need or desire to become a millionaire, I'll be quiet happy to be a thousandaire. This said I don't intend to live a peaceful life, I am happiest when I'm out of my comfort zone, to the point Im uncomfortable when things are too "safe", it's usually a sign I'm not learning (the right things). Lastly, I don't really care if I'm liked or loved (beyond my family), my network of people I truly call friends is very very small. I tend to over index on "getting things done" and can often be more interested in what people are doing as opposed to who they are, to a degree I wish this was different but its just who I am!     


# My Principles
The following are a continual set of principles that I am refining over time. The reflect how I operate as a person, as such I hope they inform a little on what I'm like.  

## Stop, reflect, and explicitly redirect.
In life I implicitly position myself to learn certain things. This positioning is usually based on what feels good or to tactically adjust for a current irritation. This often works well. How-ever what can happen is that the learnings I thought I'd have is not a pronounced as I would like and more often than not I need to learn alternative things. As such for larger changes I now take a little longer to think them through, and try to force myself to see multiple paths before picking one. This is not to get away from trusting my gut, but to make sure that my choices are fully concious and rational. I need to do this for two reasons

This is for two reasons 
1/ **Natural Growth & Path Changes**:  I've learnt that my path evolves. Early in my career I really enjoyed coding (like really enjoyed it) but when I felt I have “cracked” it to a degree I lost interest. I still find joy in it, but I moved to a higher level. I moved on to machine learning, then onto using ML to build products and then leading teams to define product success and ship ML products. Each of these areas is "fun", but as I plan my next evolution its worth reflecting on "where am I headed" as opposed to "where am I now" so that learning choices have the most impact.      

2/ **Your learning a different lesson that what you signed up for**: Often when we make a change, what we learn is not what we expected to learn. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s important to recognise and decide. With some fore-thought and second order thinking these alternative learnings will be less of a surprise. And when you are "in it", its worth asking, even thought I didn't choose this, "Is this the learning I want to make?" And while I rebase, "How can I extract as much learning out of the current situation as possible?" 


# My Goals
I (currently) have the following high goals. Keep an eye on my [rambling](posts) to see what I'm doing. 

### **Purpose** :: I will have placed deliberate effort to help uncover a 5 year purpose area or eliminated at least 4 significant candidate areas from consideration

Baz Lurmans lyrics ([suncreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI)) 
> "the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't"

 resonated with me in massively in 1997 and still resonates with me today. But now I'm older than 40. I've been lucky to be meander to where I am today, but realise I've now built up a range of skills and experineces that might just help something bigger than myself. I want to decide where to focus and grow it for the next while.

### **Connection** :: I will have developed/deepened a shared pastime with all 5 of my kids and partner

My family is an integral part of who I am. The kids are growing up fast. I want to make sure I set an anchor point, something that we can always come back to, and something that they may one day give on to their kids. My Mum gave me a love of swimming and cooking, and my Dad airplanes and science.  

### **Mastery** :: I will have tinkered with and or built with my hands 4 projects that Im proud of and will blog about.

Since becoming a manager I've lost some of my mojo. This is because my energy went from playing with technology and systems, to how to guide people and shape teams. I like building things, but realise I need time and focus. I intend to overlap this goal with other goals around purpose and connection.    

### **Mind & Body** :: I will have a weekly routine in place that steadies my mind and allows me to rejuvinate my body.

Body and mind need dedicated time. I'm lucky to have a good routine of sea swimming and cycling. I do reasonably well keeping up with medidation. But I'm a sucker for bad habits, building on the book ["the power of habit"](https://amzn.to/3vTP9jX), I intend to ensure my good habits stick and continue to make small changes to continue to accelerate this change.
