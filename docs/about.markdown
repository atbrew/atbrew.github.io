# &#129300; Who I am

I've gained insight into myself through feedback and personality tests, consistently being authentic in all aspects of my life. Early on, [DISC](https://www.discprofile.com/) assessments identified me as highly directive, but I've noticed these profiles evolve over time. A later test done via [Insights/Myers-Briggs](/assets/pdf/Insights_Directing_Motivator.pdf) identified me as a 'directing motivator.' This "motivating" trait developed in response to my work environment, emphasizing the importance of teamwork over individual effort. Organization isn't my strongest suit, and so I've learned that high thoughput can be achieved by leveraging strong strategic (& thus) motivational vision with carefully applied effective processes. This approach helps me concentrate on productivity and in a team setting minimizes unnecessary conflict.

At the end of 2023 as part of a reflective end of year exercise [year compass](https://yearcompass.com/) I started to deeply think about where I want to get to. I'd been (re-)reading up on [OKRs](https://amzn.to/42gQa1r) for my team and decided to set my own OKRs for the year. To help me do this I felt it important to refine my principles, I've always felt they were important for a team, so why not me! Ray Dalio has a nice worked exercise book to help you uncover [your own principles](https://amzn.to/496Ty18) which I have started doing. My plan is as these develop to add them here, so that I can live my first principle, being who I am all of the time.
