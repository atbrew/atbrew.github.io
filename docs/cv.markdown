**Senior Manager, Generative AI**  
***Shutterstock - Dublin, Ireland***  
*July 2023 - Present*

Shutterstock is a two-sided marketplace that allows contributors to sell images to customers. Generative AI disrupts this business model.

I lead the full stack team delivering Generative AI-powered image creation and editing tools and facilitate the wider community of practice within the department. We have built a profitable credits-based product by integrating text-to-image models from external vendors (e.g. OpenAI, Google, AWS), strategic partnerships (Databricks), and internal models. We achieve a 70%+ monthly retention rate and are rapidly gaining stock-photography market share. Our growth surpasses other significant media types on Shutterstock, supported by cohesive UX integration into Shutterstock.com by following machine learning strategies:

- **Generative Model Optimization**: We developed automated prompt refinement and parameter selection techniques, improving conversion rates by 30% on vendor-supplied models.

- **Generative Model Recomendations**: We implemented an automated text-to-image recommendation system that leverages user prompts and page context to select the best generators. This increased conversion rates by 20%+. We enabled this by doubling the speed of validation using a purpose built traffic routing system which enables  scientists to deploy independently.

- **Safety and Indemnity**: We launched automated moderation mechanisms that achieved ~100% recall in key brand safety areas (e.g., child safety) while maintaining high precision to avoid penalizing non-violating users.


**VP of AI & Engineering**  
***Streetbees :: London & Lisbon (Remote)***   
*Oct 2021 - July 2023*

Streetbees is a Series-B funded AI SaaS service that helps brands like PepsiCo and Unilever understand market trends by aggregating insights from over 3.5 million customers. This is done via an AI-powered mobile chatbot platform that drives open-form surveys, automates survey response annotation, and delivers machine learning-driven market insights.

I led the technology organization (>50 members), divided into three stream-aligned teams: acquisition, annotation, and reporting. Each team included engineering managers, software developers, data scientists, DevOps, QA, and data analysts. I was responsible for the technical and scientific strategy across the organization, ensuring each team could operate autonomously.

Notable achievements under my leadership:

- **Aquisition:** Reduced human moderation time for fraudulent image submissions by 75%. Our algorithm automatically identified over 80% of near-duplicate image submissions and screen captures as part of a review recommendation engine.


- **Annotation:** Cut manual coding costs by over 60% by upgrading a legacy text-only classification system. Our cross-modality deep learning model increased automated code discovery by over 300%,  removing the need for extensive manual annotation in primary survey domains (such as beauty).


- **Reporting:**  Fully automated the survey curation, delivery, and research report creation using GPT-3. This innovation cut the end-to-end client delivery time from over two weeks to days. This has ultimately led to a company pivot and the launch of a new product, [Streetbees-X](https://www.streetbees.com/SBX).


**Head of NLP Centre of Excellence**   
***Zalando :: Berlin (Remote)***  
*Jul 2020 - Oct 2021*

Zalando established four Centres of AI Excellence to drive innovation across areas such as NLP, Image Processing, Econometrics, and Forecasting. These centres enabled and seeded teams across Zalando with cutting-edge technologies.

I set up and led the NLP Centre of Excellence. I was responsible for the technical, product, and scientific direction of the centre. The team, consisting of 10 senior researchers, product managers, data engineers, and a data analyst, incubated technologies and supported the formation of new product-focused research teams across Zalando.

Key accomplishments include:

- **Platform Capabilities:** Developed a GDPR-compliant, multilingual customer feedback search and message routing tool. This platform ingested data from 18 languages across 40 customer touchpoints, consolidating all customer feedback into a single platform.

- **Content Moderation:** Incubated an automated moderation team for product safety issues flagged by the customer returns process. The tool, based on our [state-of-the-art](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14363) research, achieved over 95% recall in flagging unsafe products, expediting their removal with human-in-the-loop escalation to the manual inspection team.

- **Product-Led Scientific Advances:** Developed [novel text clustering techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00086) for identifying new categories of customer feedback and product risks. We also pioneered a zero-shot classification technique using transformer architecture and contributed to the [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_10_TRAINING_ZERO_SHOT_MODEL.md) open-source NLP project, originally developed by Zalando Research.

**Supervisory Board Member**   
***Zalando SE***   
*May 2018 - Jun 2020*

I served as a member of Zalando's 8-seat supervisory board, working alongside key shareholder representatives including Cristina Stenbeck (Kinnevik), Anders Holch Povlsen (CEO of Bestseller Group), Kelly Bennett (CMO of Netflix), Mariella Röhm-Kottmann (KPMG), Alexander Samwer (Rocket Internet), and fellow Zalando employees Konrad Schäfers and Beate Siert.

The board was responsible for fiduciary oversight of Zalando. This included making decisions on significant policy changes, investments, divestitures, executive promotions, remuneration, and managing relationships with strategic investors and key brand partners.

**Head of Customer Data Platform**  
*Zalando*  
*Jan 2016 - Jul 2020*

Zalando, Europe’s largest fashion e-commerce platform, expanded its technical workforce in 2015 by opening new technology hubs in Dublin and Helsinki.

I was a founding member of the Customer Data Platform and progressed from Senior Scientist to Head of Applied Science. I led a team of 25, including managers, applied scientists, engineers, and product managers, organized into three teams: 1) Customer Preference Recommendations, 2) Customer Price Predictions, and 3) Cross Device Graph. We integrated services across Zalando’s main business units: Lounge, Markets, Zalon, ZMS, and Fashion Store.

Key accomplishments include:

- **Customer Preference Recommendations:** Our fashion attribute recommendation services, including category, brand, and price, powered customer preference collection, recommendation carousels, personalized navigation, gift card recommendations, newsletters, and offsite targeted advertising. These integrations drove double-digit improvements in A/B tests over existing solutions.

- **Audience Targeting:** Our predictive audience generation tools, used by ZMS, Zalon, and Markets, achieved up to 40x performance over legacy systems in early campaigns which externally drove client retention (ZMS) and internally enabled deeper market penetration (Zalon & Markets).

- **Cross-Device Graph:** Our cross-device graph improved advertising attribution by replacing the marketing team’s user association model. This led to a 40% increase in attributed sales significantly enhancing Zalando’s marketing performance. We also integrated this system into Zalando’s A/B testing platform, reducing test noise by double digits for cookie-based tests.

**Senior Applied Scientist**  
*IBM*  
*Apr 2012 - Jan 2016*

I was the Lead Applied Scientist in IBM’s SmartCloud division, responsible for inventing, optimizing, and delivering machine learning software to enhance IT network monitoring. I was initially hired to drive machine learning-enabled metrics management and later helped form a new team focused on event analytics.

Key accomplishments include:

- **Event Analytics:** As part of a two-person discovery team, I co-developed new event analytics capabilities that helped protect IBM from immediate competitive threats. With market traction, I expanded the team to 14 contributors across the USA, UK, and Ireland. We covered design, UX, engineering, and applied science. I co-invented 16 patents in event analytics, reducing client workloads by 30% and decreasing Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) by 10%.

- **Metrics Management:** I led a major redesign of the metrics anomaly generation product, improving disk I/O by 1000x (from 3.5 GB to 3.5 MB per 5-minute interval) and processing speed by 40x (from 5 minutes to 7 seconds per interval). The redesign also cut memory use by 2.5x (from 70 GB to 20 GB) and enabled independently testable machine learning extensions. This doubled the system's detection methods, added memory leak detectors, and cut false alerts by 50%.

**Data Scientist / Software Engineer**  
***Swrve***  
*June 2011 - Mar 2012*

Developed Swrve's SaaS A/B testing engine and implemented tracking metrics based on tracking event streams. Implemented front-end UX in Ruby & JQuery, backend in Java with a Redis, Cassandra, and MySQL storage layer, hosted on Amazon EC2.
