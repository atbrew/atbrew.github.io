## Experience

### VP of AI & Engineering
Streetbees :: London & Lisbon (Remote)
Oct 2021 - Present

Streetbees is a multi-award-winning Marketing AI SaaS service built on AWS that enables brands such as Pepsico and Unilever to connect with 3.5 Million customers "in the moment" of consumption through an AI-driven mobile chatbot survey and data processing system.

In May 2022, my management portfolio was expanded from AI and data engineering to cover the entire 50+ technology organization. This is composed of senior engineering managers, tech leads, software developers, applied science, DevOps, QA, and data analysts. In collaboration with product leadership, we restructured the product and tech org into 3 cross-functional mission-oriented tribes. I helped set product, technical, and scientific direction for each tribe to enable autonomous execution.

Some examples observed since the change:
- Manual coding costs reduced by 60% through implementation of task realignment and online precision and recall monitoring of the crowd workforce combined with full automation of the train-deploy machine learning annotation system.
- A 365% increase in automated codes discovered by extending automatic coding to include images (not just text) in a move to a multimodal two-tower classification paradigm.
- A 75% reduction in QA time on fraudulent image submission based on algorithms identifying 80% of near duplicate image submissions and screen captures as part of a review recommendation engine.

The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 enabled my team to build a fully automated end-to-end survey curation, quality assurance, one-shot encoding, and report writing product that was presented to the StreetBees board. A full working prototype has been released to beta customers, and the company is now moving from large agency-style contracts to a full SaaS offering based on the innovations and technology our team developed.

### Head of NLP Centre of Excellence
Zalando :: Berlin (Remote)
Jul 2020 - Oct 2021

Zalando wished to expedite moving near-term research innovation from the Zalando research team so that the business would have more immediate benefit, and Zalando research could focus on blue skies research. Four Centres of AI Excellence were planned to focus on enabling and seeding other Zalando teams with near and mid-term innovations. This is where recent advances in the state of the art (e.g., in NLP) would have immediate and near-term (1-5 year) impact.

I set up and led the first of the new centers, the NLP Centre of Excellence. I provided technical, product, and scientific leadership for the nascent Natural Language Processing (NLP) Centre of Excellence. Our initial cross-functional team of 10 was made up of 3 senior researchers, 2 senior product managers, 3 data engineers, and a data analyst. The team was planned to grow to >20. I set and communicated the strategic product, technical, and scientific direction in collaboration with my product, science, and technology team. The department seeded new teams across Zalando by hiring and building pre-baked teams with leaders to take those teams forward. The department also built a foundational NLP platform product which acted as an anchor to enable continual research in the center.

Some accomplishments include:
- Two leads from the center now lead new teams based on work they developed in the center (a new customer reviews applied science and engineering team & a new semantic search applied science and engineering team).
- Led product discovery, architecture, and early implementation of our core customer feedback analysis product "classlytics". Classlytics was GDPR compliant by design enabling multilingual search and message routing of customer feedback for 18 languages from over 40 different customer journey touchpoints (e.g., return slips & online feedback forms). The product safety inspection team used it as a high recall (95%+) human in the loop automated escalation tool to forward safety concerns to their manual inspection team to expedite the removal of potentially unsafe products from Zalando.

### Board Member
Zalando
May 2018 - Jun 2020 (2 years 2 months)

German companies are "co-determined," that is, they are led by a board of directors that is split between shareholder representatives and employee representatives. I was invited to apply for a vacant position on the board given my background in machine learning and technology that was deemed to be highly complementary to the wider board structure.

I was one of 3 elected employees on the 8-seat supervisory board of Zalando charged with fiduciary care of the company. I participated in quarterly board meetings and ensured due diligence was applied to significant Zalando policy changes, investment, divestments, reviewing executive-level promotions and remuneration, and partaking in strategic investor and key brand relationship meetings. For example:
- Oversaw the divestment in the Brieselang Logistics site, Zalando inhouse fashion brand, Kickz, Bread & Butter, and the closure of the Lisbon technology hub.
- Oversaw the expansion of the board from the 3 original founders to 5.
- Participated in strategic offsites and round tables with Kinnevik and Nike.
- Raised issues with the process and the algorithmic evaluation of employees, which helped to drive change in the bi-annual employee appraisal process.

### Head of Customer Data Platform
Zalando
Jan 2016 - Jul 2020 (4 years 7 months)

Zalando is the largest fashion e-commerce platform in Europe. In 2015, Zalando aimed to rapidly expand its technical workforce. It did this by opening new technology hubs in Dublin & Helsinki. The Zalando Dublin site was set up to be a data science innovation hub, known as the Fashion Insights Centre. Three departments were set up on the site: the fashion content platform to provide insights into the latest trends in fashion, the smart product platform to enable deep and rich metadata about products onboarded onto the platform, and the customer data platform to provide a 360-degree view of customers interacting with the platform. The core challenge for all these departments was to integrate into the wider Zalando business.

I was an early founding team member of the customer data platform and eventually became the head of applied science for that department. At the department's peak, I led a team of 25 managers, applied scientists, engineers, and product managers, enabling teams to leverage factual and predicted customer data to optimize customer experience. I helped propose, design, and build services that were integrated into the business processes of 4 Zalando business units: Lounge, Markets, Zalon, ZMS, and Fashion Store.

Some accomplishments include:
- Our fashion attribute prediction services (e.g., category, brand, price) drove customer preference collection, recommendation carousels, personalized navigation, gift card recommendation, personalized newsletters, offsite targeted advertising, and as an implicit signal into search ranking.
- Our audience generation tools were used by ZMS, Zalon, and Markets teams for reach and performance-based campaign targeting. Some early campaigns outperformed legacy systems by 40x. We also developed a full customer segmentation model known as Z-types in collaboration with ZMS, which features in Zalando's 2017 annual report. For example, Z-Types were leveraged by G-Star to reach 8 Million Users selling 35K items.
- Our cross-device graph replaced the marketing team's user association model for advertising attribution, leading to a 40% increase in attributed sales. We also integrated this into Zalando's A/B testing platform with double-digit de-noising for tests that leveraged cookies.

### Lead Applied Scientist
IBM
Apr 2012 - Jan 2016 (3 years 10 months)

Lead Applied Scientist in the IBM SmartCloud division responsible for invention, optimization, and delivery of machine learning software to optimize and simplify IT Network monitoring.

Event Analytics:
- Part of a discovery team of 2 that explored and built new event analytics capabilities, which successfully warded off immediate competitive pressure.
- Helped grow the team to 14 contributors covering the USA, UK, and Ireland with design, UX, engineering, and applied science.
- Invented and developed a patented set of event analytics suite of algorithms that enables a 30% reduction of client workloads with a 10% reduction in Mean Time to Repair for the remaining workload.
- Lead author on 16 patents, became a member of the IBM Ireland and Tivoli Patent Review Committees.

Metrics Management:
- Led a software and analytics engineering redesign of the core of the metrics anomaly generation product.
- This yielded a 1000X improvement in disk IO (3.5 GB writes per interval reduced to 3.5 MB per interval) and a 40X speed up (5 minutes per interval reduced to 7 seconds) with a 2.5 X reduction in memory footprint (70GB reduced to 20GB).
- Continuous Improvement was enabled by "pluggable" independently testable extensions. Using this, we doubled the number of anomaly methods provided by the system (e.g., adding memory leak detectors) and reduced the false alerts raised by the system by 50%.

### Data Scientist / Software Engineer
Swrve
June 2011 - Mar 2012

Developed Swrve's SaaS A/B testing engine and implemented tracking metrics based on tracking event streams. Implemented front-end UX in Ruby & JQuery, backend in Java with a Redis, Cassandra, and MySQL storage layer, hosted on Amazon EC2.
