# Blogs 
These are blogs that I currently actively read or find useful

- [John Cutlers Blog](https://cutlefish.substack.com/) John who was behind Amplitudes North Star frame work provides a continuous stream of thought that help shape my view points around mental models for delivery in organisations.    
- [Simon Wardleys Blog](https://blog.gardeviance.org/) The author of [Wardley Maps](https://learnwardleymapping.com/) who has shared interesting thoughts on the different roles that appear in teams over time [(Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners)](https://orghacking.com/pioneers-settlers-town-planners-wardley-9dcd3709cde7)
- [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk/) Creator of Ruby on Rails, interesting thoughts around remote work & leadership.
- [Ryan Singer](https://feltpresence.com/) Talks about shaping and scoping work, that enable parallel mission driven delivery. In particular I find the ShapeUp process a strong candidate to balance discovery and shipping inventive and machine learning products because the blocks that are big enough to enable meaningful inventive discovery & deliver, but small enough to enable us to change course.
