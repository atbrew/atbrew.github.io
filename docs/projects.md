    description: I wrote a site <a href="http://hideprice.com/">hideprice.com</a> with my wife in 2010. Back then I shipped the code to the "production" servers manually with dubious amounts of ssh tunnels & rsync commands. I was using subversion if I recall correctly. I've used this as my "back to code" project to deploy the the old site using a more modern approach. Im using Github Actions combined with Terraform as my CI/CD as the main outcome of my learning. The site is a reverse proxy, that regex's out prices for the pages that it serves. It not longer works for all sites because it has not kep up with many new web frameworkd. But it gives you a flavor of what I was up to in 2010, and gives you a view of what I am re-learning to do today.
