*2024-01-25*

I have set myself a goal to blog 4 blog worthy projects. This is to stretch myself beyond my comfort zone and to learn something fun along the way. 

As a kid I loved building lego, and more recently we got a 3d-printer based on the recomendation from a collegue at work. 

The lego set I lover the most as a kid was probably the simplist to build a 2d plotter. Im also always looking for projects where I can get the kids excited. My eldest son Ryan has got a fondness for chess, to the point I just dont have a hope at beating him (but I was never that good anyways).

This leads me to my first project codenamed "Daddy". I'm going to try to build an automated chess board similar to square off. I intend to print component parts (I might end up buying them) to build a 2d plotter that will be controlled by a raspberry pi. On the arm instead of a pen I will put an electromagnet that will operate the chess peices from the underside of the board. 

Now Ryan will be able to play against Daddy, and if I play against him I will have a button aptly named "what would Daddy do" to help me play the best move given my current position. 

Lets see how it goes! So far I have bought 
- the electro-magnet 
- a cobbler for a raspberry pi 5 
- I had a raspberry pi 5 for my birthday (thansk Angie!) 
- a 50 x 50 sheet of perspex. 

I will need to buy some continual servos, and possibly some linear rails. I also believe I will need hall effect transistors to be able to identufy the location of all of the peieces on the board. 

My plan in february is to start coding / building this by doing a little day be day
