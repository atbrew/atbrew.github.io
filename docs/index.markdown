<p>I'm <b>Dr. Anthony Brew</b>, an experienced product and technology professional. I'm passionate about enabling teams to collaborate in developing innovative software products in high-uncertainty domains.</p>

<p>In my opinion a clear and unambiguous <b>purpose</b> is the central ingredient for empowered and effective teamwork. When purpose is supported by a thoughtfully designed <b>organizational setup</b> and refined <b>team processes</b>, it minimizes friction among team members.</p>

<p>Ive found methodologies such as the Amazon <a href="https://amzn.to/3qtEtWt">working backwards</a> process and the <a href="https://info.amplitude.com/north-star-playbook">Amplitude North Star</a> framework effectively articulate a clear direction for organizations and teams.</p>

<p>When thinking about team setup, I find the organizational thinking in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3Nam0XO">Team Topologies</a> valuable. Understanding how teams work and interact is crucial.</p>

<p>I recommend exploring the Spotify <a href="https://medium.com/pm101/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761"> Squad Model</a> and working in bets using <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup"> Shape Up</a> as solid starting points for effective team execution.</p>

<p>Understanding the psychology of individuals and teams is crucial in complex team setups. Starting with what makes us motivates us as individual, Daniel Pinks book <a href="https://amzn.to/43oJTAp">Drive</a> is a valuable resource (Zalando's Radical Agility was based on it). Teams and organisations often have perosnalites of thier own, Ive found books from Patrick Lencioni such as <a href="https://amzn.to/43Ccz8X">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3NdgFiv">The Advantage</a> helpful in framing my thinking.</p>

<p>This website is primarily for <b>my personal use,</b>. I plan to develop my thinking and share personal projects related to enhancing team alignment and productivity using AI software.</p>
