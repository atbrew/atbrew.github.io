<p>I'm <b>Dr. Anthony Brew</b>, an experienced product and technology professional. I'm passionate about enabling teams to collaborate in developing innovative software products in high-uncertainty domains. </p> 

<p>Typically, I have specialised in the specification, development and deployment of systems that leevrage machine learning. This has ranged from basic and advanced statistical models (e.g. statistical process control & A/B testing), to predictive systems (e.g. churn prediction and recomender engines) to the latest state of the art in NLP and computer vision (e.g. LLM's and Multimodal classificatiopn system) </p>

<p> But above that I'm a Dad to 5 wonderful kids, and lucky to be the husband of an amazing woman (She puts up with me!). </p>

<p>This website is primarily for <b>my personal use.</b>. But you can use it to learn a bit more about <a href="/about">who I am</a>, what I have <a href="/cv">worked on</a> and occasionally I <a href="/posts">ramble</a> about projects I'm working on or things that I'm <a href="links">reading</a></p>
