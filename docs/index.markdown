<p>I'm <b>Dr. Anthony Brew</b>, an experienced product and technology professional. I'm passionate about enabling teams to collaborate in developing innovative software products in high-uncertainty domains.</p>

<p> But above that I'm a Dad to 5 wonderful kids, and lucky to be the husband of an amazing woman (She puts up with me!).

<p>This website is primarily for <b>my personal use,</b>. I plan to develop my thinking by writing here and share personal projects.</p>
