Hi Im <b>Dr. Anthony Brew</b>, a product and technology professional with experience shipping software across various domains, including academia, start-ups, scale-ups, and enterprise businesses. 

</p>
<p>
Im really interested in helping teams build <b>inventive/high-uncertainty</b> software products together. By inventive, I mean software where the solution is not known a-priori, but we "know" that a solution does exist, we just dont know how well it will perform or the exact delivery vehicle for it. Typically these software products have a machine learning component to them, but the mechanism in how they are successfully delivered relies on product and design thinking, user experience and large doses of really great software engineering.

I have observed clear *purpose*; unambiguously stated, is a vital driver of empowered effective teamwork. When this is supported by thoughtfully and continually refined team processes magic can happen. As an scientist by trade, Im currently exploring ways that AI software can enabling teams alignment and hence enhance their productivity.

</p>
<p>

Im inspired by methodologies such as the Amazon working backwards discovery process as described in <a href="https://amzn.to/3Na7Sh6">Shipping Greatness</a>, Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pias's organisational thinking in <a href="https://amzn.to/3Nam0XO"> Team Topologies </a>, and the psychology of people and teams by writers such as Patrick Lencioni in <a href="https://amzn.to/43Ccz8X">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team </a>

<b>This website is primarily for "me"</b>. I plan to use it to develop my thinking and share my personal projects. If what you find here is useful that's great, I'd love to hear from you to understand what you found interesting or useful.
