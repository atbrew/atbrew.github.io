Im <b>Dr. Anthony Brew</b>, a product and technology professional with <a href="cv.html">experience</a> shipping software across various domains, including academia, start-ups, scale-ups, and enterprise businesses. 

</p>
<p>
I'm passionate about enabling teams to collaborate in developing innovative software products in <b>high-uncertainty</b> domains.
By high-uncertainty, I mean software where the solution is not known a-priori or involves a stochastic process that needs tamed. Often we "know" that a solution exists, we just dont know how well it will perform or the exact delivery vehicle for it. Typically these software products have a machine learning component to them, but the mechanism in how they are successfully delivered relies on product and design thinking, user experience and large doses of really great software engineering.
</p>
<p>
I have observed clear <b>purpose</b>; unambiguously stated, is a vital driver of empowered effective teamwork. It provides everyone on the team a clear north-star enables them to actively invent, participate and challenge how we get there. 
</p>
<p>
When purpose is supported by thoughtfully designed <b>organisational setup</b> and continually refined <b>team processes</b> allot of the friction seen between team members and teams is minimised. In my view the word process has a bad name. This is because process is a two edged sword, bad process is like a salted knife in the teams collective kidney, the team hates it and the dont see the point. Good process on the other hand works for the team as a gaurd-rail to help us remain focused on our collective purpose. 
</p>

<p>

In setting and communications purpose, I've found methodologies such as the Amazon working backwards process as described in <a href="https://amzn.to/3Na7Sh6">Shipping Greatness</a> and the <a href="https://info.amplitude.com/north-star-playbook">Amplitude North Star framework</a> to be extremely effective. This is because of their ability to well articulate a clear direction for organisations and teams in a way that teams can build a shared view.
</p>

<p>

My go to resource for thinking of team setup is that by Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pias's organisational thinking in <a href="https://amzn.to/3Nam0XO"> Team Topologies </a>. When we think of teams and interactions between teams I find it interesting to think about how we work as a team. My cultural north star was very affected by my time at Zalando in particular the era of Radical Agility where the tech constitution was designed around what motivates us as human beings based on Daniel Pinks book <a href="https://amzn.to/3WUjWqb">Drive</a>. Brining personal autonomy, mastery and purpose together is hard for teams. For this reason I find ideas like the <a href="https://medium.com/pm101/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761">Spotify Squad Model</a> which helps to solidify the mission statement, or working in Bets using <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> to be a solid starting point.
</p>

<p>
Our team setups are way more complicated than the above and so this would not be complete without getting an understanding of the psychology of people and teams. For me Ive particularly enjoyed Patrick Lencioni in <a href="https://amzn.to/43Ccz8X">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team </a> and over arching this his book <a href="https://amzn.to/3NdgFiv">The Advantage</a>.

<b>Now that you know a bit about me, lets set the context for this website. This website is primarily for "me"</b>. I plan to use it to develop my thinking and share my personal projects.
As an scientist by trade, Im currently exploring ways that AI software can enabling teams alignment and hence enhance their productivity.
If what you find here is useful that's great, I'd love to hear from you to understand what you found interesting or useful.
