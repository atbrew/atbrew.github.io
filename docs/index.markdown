Im <b>Dr. Anthony Brew</b>, a product and technology professional with <a href="cv.html">experience</a> shipping software across various domains, including academia, start-ups, scale-ups, and enterprise businesses. 

</p>
<p>
I'm passionate about collaborating with teams to develop innovative software products in <b>high-uncertainty</b> domains.
By high-uncertainty, I mean software where the solution is not known a-priori or involves a stochastic process that needs tamed. Often we "know" that a solution exists, we just dont know how well it will perform or the exact delivery vehicle for it. Typically these software products have a machine learning component to them, but the mechanism in how they are successfully delivered relies on product and design thinking, user experience and large doses of really great software engineering.
</p>
<p>
I have observed clear <b>purpose</b>; unambiguously stated, is a vital driver of empowered effective teamwork. It provides everyone on the team a clear north-star enables them to actively invent, participate and challenge how we get there. 
</p>
<p>
When purpose is supported by thoughtfully and continually refined <b>team processes</b> allot of the friction seen between team members and teams is minimised. In my view the word process has a bad name. This is because process is a two edged sword, bad process is like a salted knife in the teams collective kidney, the team hates it and the dont see the point. Good process on the other hand works for the team as a gaurdrail to help us remain focused on our collective purpose.

Im inspired by methodologies such as the Amazon working backwards discovery process as described in <a href="https://amzn.to/3Na7Sh6">Shipping Greatness</a>, Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pias's organisational thinking in <a href="https://amzn.to/3Nam0XO"> Team Topologies </a>, and the psychology of people and teams by writers such as Patrick Lencioni in <a href="https://amzn.to/43Ccz8X">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team </a>

<b>This website is primarily for "me"</b>. I plan to use it to develop my thinking and share my personal projects.
As an scientist by trade, Im currently exploring ways that AI software can enabling teams alignment and hence enhance their productivity.
If what you find here is useful that's great, I'd love to hear from you to understand what you found interesting or useful.
